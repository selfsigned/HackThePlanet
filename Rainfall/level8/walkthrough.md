# Level 8

We have a big main and 2 global variables: `auth` and `service`.
The main continuously asks for input, with the valid commands being: `auth `(notice the space), `service`, `reset` and `login`.

I was able to get the flag just using the following commands in this order: auth , service, service, login.
But obviously that's not enough for the walkthrough. I spent some time trying to decipher the source but it is a pain.
